*The necessity of the project:
- Every year, floods result in numerous injuries and fatalities, particularly in
areas prone to storms and heavy rainfall. An AIOT system can be
developed to mitigate these problem
* Review of the literature:
-The review of literature will explore existing research and technologies
related to flood detection and monitoring systems, AIoT applications in
natural disaster management, and specific studies on flood-prone
mountainous regions.
* Research objectives:
-Develop a flood detection and monitoring system using AIoT technology.
-Implement real-time data analysis and early warning capabilities for
flood-prone mountain slopes.
* Addressed problems:
-People found injured or dead every year by flood, especially in
flood-prone mountain slopes or areas where storms often happen.
* Target audience:
-Residents potentially affected by flooding in mountainous areas
* Expected outcomes/benefits:
-prevent natural disasters.
-minimize injuries/deaths
