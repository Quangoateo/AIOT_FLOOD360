### Project Necessity
Every year, floods result in numerous injuries and fatalities, particularly in areas prone to storms and heavy rainfall. An AIoT system can be developed to mitigate these problems by providing early warnings and real-time monitoring.

---

### Literature Review
The literature review will explore:
- Existing research and technologies related to flood detection and monitoring systems.
- AIoT applications in natural disaster management.
- Specific studies on flood-prone mountainous regions.

---

### Research Objectives
- **Develop** a flood detection and monitoring system using AIoT technology.
- **Implement** real-time data analysis and early warning capabilities for flood-prone mountainous areas.

---

### Addressed Problems
Every year, people are injured or found dead due to floods, especially in flood-prone mountain slopes or regions where storms frequently occur.

---

### Target Audience
Residents living in or near mountainous areas that are vulnerable to flooding.

---

### Expected Outcomes/Benefits
- **Prevent** natural disasters by providing timely warnings.
- **Minimize** injuries and deaths caused by flooding.
